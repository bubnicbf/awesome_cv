Okay, so based on an analysis of this report, you should be worth $123k. But this is a start-up (anything less than 10 years old with 75 employees is definitely a start-up). And so you have the opportunity to ask for stock at the same time as selling your value.

So, they're offering $45k. Based on that survey, you should be able to provide an additional $78k of value to the company annually. Now you can let your data science skills shine: prove to the company that you are worth it.

The first thing to look at is the percentage of the company they are giving you. Take the total amount that the company spends on you to be 1.5x your salary (including overheads etc.). So what you'll need to do is find out the value of the company. Suppose it's $5M per annum. So then the company is spending 1.35%. That's 1.35% of the company going to you.

Now what is your expected output for this situation. Now your value, again based on national averages, is $123k. So you should be asking for 3.69%, but that is highly dependent on what your projected output will be. In the general case, if n is the fraction of the company you're giving up, the deal is a good one if it makes the company worth more than 1/(1 - n). In other words, you should be able to sell that you can make 3.83% of the company in profit, or just shy of $200k. Experian Data Quality research shows an average of 12% revenue lost from bad data. That's $600k for our hypothetical here. So if you can sell a 10% reduction in bad data for the next four years, then you've proven your value to the company. Alternatively, if you can sell a 5% reduction in bad over the four years, then you've proven a $75k salary/stock value to the company. And this is just cleaning a (very) small amount of bad data. There are bunch of other projects you can use to bring value to the company.

You can adjust the $5M figure as you need to get other, more accurate figures. But you get the idea. If it were me applying to a $5M startup, I would counter with $50k salary plus a 20% Bonus and $200K stock vested over the next 3 years.
